`posish` provides efficient memory-safe and [I/O-safe] wrappers to "POSIX-ish"
`libc` APIs and syscalls.

`posish` is relatively low-level and does not support Windows; for higher-level
and portable APIs to this functionality, see the [`system-interface`],
[`cap-std`], and [`fs-set-times`] crates.

### Linux raw syscall support

On Linux, `posish` can optionally be configured to use the raw Linux syscall
ABI directly instead of `libc`. To enable this, set the `RUSTFLAGS` environment
variable to `--cfg linux_raw`, or otherwise pass `--cfg linux_raw` to rustc.
This mode is new, and so far only supports x86-64, x86, and aarch64, but a fair
amount of code has been successfully adapted to use it, and ports to most other
architectures should be straightforward.

This feature is fun in four ways:
 - By being implemented entirely in Rust, avoiding `libc`, `errno`, and pthread
   cancellation, and using type layout optimizations, most functions compile
   down to very efficient code and can even (on Rust nightly) be fully inlined
   into user code.
 - Memory buffers are kept in Rust slices, out parameters are returned as
   regular values, and file descriptors are kept in [`io-lifetimes`] types,
   so most functions preserve memory safety and I/O safety all the way down
   to the syscalls.
 - It uses a crate-level `deny(unsafe_code)`. While there are a few places that
   use `allow(unsafe_code)` locally to override this in places where `unsafe`
   is unavoidable, most of the code is safe.
 - It uses a 64-bit `time_t` type on 32-bit platforms, avoiding the
   [y2038 bug].
